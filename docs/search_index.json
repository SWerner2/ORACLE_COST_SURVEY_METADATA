Currenlty survey data from years 2011, 2012, 2015 are databased on Oracle. 1.1 SSB Cost Survey The Greater Atlantic Region Commercial Fishing Business Cost Survey (commercial fishing cost survey or cost survey for short) is a voluntary cost survey of federally permitted vessel owners in the New England and Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Two main goals of the survey are to collect fixed and quasi-fixed cost information to generate vessel-level profitability estimates, as well as track economic performance over time to inform management decisions. The survey has been implemented intermittently since 2006. 1.2 Confidentiality Data confidentiality is of the utmost importance. Each individual that accesses the cost data must have a signed non-disclosure agreement which specifies the cost data by name. Data users must be aware of the restrictions with handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII). As a reminder, data cannot be shared through email and must follow the rule of three to protect confidentiality. Data cannot be shared without notifying cost working group staff and obtaining a singed NDA. For any questions or more on the confidentiality of the cost survey data, please contact Samantha Werner (Samantha.Werner@noaa.gov) and Gregory Ardini (Gregory.Ardini@noaa.gov). 1.3 Contacts For questions regarding, the metadata, the Oracle databases(including access), or suggestions, please contact Samantha Werner (Samantha.Werner@noaa.gov) "],["tables-and-views.html", "Chapter2 Tables and Views 2.1 VCS_COMMON_VARIABLES_MV 2.2 VCS_COST2011 2.3 VCS_COST2012 2.4 VCS_COST2015", " Chapter2 Tables and Views 2.1 VCS_COMMON_VARIABLES_MV Description: This view presents common variables collected from the cost survey over time. Values are presented at the annual vessel-level for the year in which they were queried unless otherwise noted (nominal dollars). To be considered a common variable, the variable must appear in two or more cost surveys over time. Given that the survey instrument changed over time, there may be slight discrepancies in the variable over time. Please see the comments for further clarification.The primary key is HULLNUM and SURVEY_YEAR (not VESSEL_NAME). Data warnings: Crew_Pymts in this year contains both crew and captain payments.

Currenlty survey data from years 2011, 2012, 2015 are databased on Oracle. 1.1 SSB Cost Survey The Greater Atlantic Region Commercial Fishing Business Cost Survey (commercial fishing cost survey or cost survey for short) is a voluntary cost survey of federally permitted vessel owners in the New England and Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Two main goals of the survey are to collect fixed and quasi-fixed cost information to generate vessel-level profitability estimates, as well as track economic performance over time to inform management decisions. The survey has been implemented intermittently since 2006. 1.2 Confidentiality Data confidentiality is of the utmost importance. Each individual that accesses the cost data must have a signed non-disclosure agreement which specifies the cost data by name. Data users must be aware of the restrictions with handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII). As a reminder, data cannot be shared through email and must follow the rule of three to protect confidentiality. Data cannot be shared without notifying cost working group staff and obtaining a singed NDA. For any questions or more on the confidentiality of the cost survey data, please contact Samantha Werner (Samantha.Werner@noaa.gov) and Gregory Ardini (Gregory.Ardini@noaa.gov). 1.3 Contacts For questions regarding, the metadata, the Oracle databases(including access), or suggestions, please contact Samantha Werner (Samantha.Werner@noaa.gov) "],["tables-and-views.html", "Chapter2 Tables and Views 2.1 VCS_COMMON_VARIABLES_MV 2.2 VCS_COST2011 2.3 VCS_COST2012 2.4 VCS_COST2015", " Chapter2 Tables and Views 2.1 VCS_COMMON_VARIABLES_MV Description: This view presents common variables collected from the cost survey over time.
