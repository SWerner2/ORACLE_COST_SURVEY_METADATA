# Overview 

This website serves as the official metadata for the SSB cost survey data, databased on Oracle. 
Currenlty survey data from years 2011, 2012, 2015 are databased on Oracle. 

## SSB Cost Survey  
The Greater Atlantic Region Commercial Fishing Business Cost Survey (commercial fishing cost survey or cost survey for short) is a voluntary cost survey of federally permitted vessel owners in the New England and Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Two main goals of the survey are to collect fixed and quasi-fixed cost information to generate vessel-level profitability estimates, as well as track economic performance over time to inform management decisions. The survey has been implemented intermittently since 2006. 

## Confidentiality  

Data confidentiality is of the utmost importance. Each individual that accesses the cost data must have a signed non-disclosure agreement which specifies the cost data by name.
Data users must be aware of the restrictions with handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII). As a reminder, data cannot be shared through email and must follow the rule of three to protect confidentiality. Data cannot be shared without notifying cost working group staff and obtaining a singed NDA. 
For any questions or more on the confidentiality of the cost survey data, please contact Samantha Werner (Samantha.Werner@noaa.gov) and Gregory Ardini (Gregory.Ardini@noaa.gov).
